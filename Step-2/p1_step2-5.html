  <center><p id="dave">The hyperlink was my currency six years ago. </p>
    <br><br><br>

 <p id="two"> Stemming from the idea of the hypertext, the hyperlink provided a diversity and decentralisation that the real world lacked.</p>

    <p id="three" "> The hyperlink represented the open, interconnected spirit of the world wide web - a vision that started with its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee.</p>
    <p id="four"> The hyperlink was a way to abandon centralization - all the links, lines and hierarchies - and replace them with something more distributed, a system of nodes and networks.</p>

  <p style="transform: rotate(50deg)">Blogs gave form to that spirit of decentralization: 
    <p style="color:red;">They were windows into lives you'd rarely know much about;</p>
    <p style="transform: rotate(-50deg)" > bridges that connected differet lives to each other and thereby changed them.</p>
    <p style="transform: rotate(-20deg)"> Blogs were cafes where people exchanged diverse ideas on any and every topic you could possibly be interested in.</p>
    <p style="transform: rotate(70deg)"> They were Tehran's taxicabs writ large.</p>

  <h1><p style="color:red; font-size:30pt"; >Since I got out of jail, though, I've realized how much the hyperlink has been devalued, almost made obsolete.</h1></p>

  <p style="transform: rotate(-19deg)"> Nearly every social network now treats a link as just the same as it treats any other object </p>
  <p style="transform: rotate(80deg)"> - the same as a photo, or a piece of text - instead of seeing it as a way to make that text richer.</p>
  <p style="transform: rotate(55deg)"> You're encouraged to post one single hyperlink and expose it to a quasi-democratic process of liking and plussing and hearting:</p>
  <p style="transform: rotate(25deg)"> Adding several links to a piece of text is usually not allowed.</p> 
    <p style="color:red;">Hyperlinks are objectivized, isolated, stripped of their powers.</p>

  <p style="transform: rotate(25deg)""> At the same time, these social networks tend to treat native text and pictures </p>
<p style="transform: rotate(-25deg)">- things that are directly posted to them - with a lot more respect than those that reside on outside web pages.</p>
<p style="transform: rotate(-5deg)"> One photographer friend explained to me how the images he uploads directly to Facebook receive a large number of likes, which in turn means they appear more on other people's news feeds.</p>
<p style="transform: rotate(5deg)"> On the other hand, when he posts a link to the same picture somewhere outside Facebook </p>
<p style="transform: rotate(35deg)"> - his now-dusty blog, for instance - </p>
<p style="transform: rotate(40deg)">the images are much less visible to Facebook itself, and therefore get far fewer likes. The cycle reinforces itself.</p>
